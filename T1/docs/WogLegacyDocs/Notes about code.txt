
To add trigger:
- create hook in global_hooks.h (NewWog) to call your function
- edit ERM variables if trigger requires it
- set global variable 'pointer' to identifier of trigger
- call function 'ProcessERM();'
- done, parser will deal with everything else

Testing trigger: !?UU; and receiver !!UU...
Added for convenience, they are stored in separate files: TestingERM.h/cpp
For experiments and testing only. For trigger, use pointer=30378.
