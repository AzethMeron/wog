Changelog AFTER Alpha 8.0, by WoG Legacy Team

New syntax for receiver BA
	!!BA:B#/1;
		$ - string, z-var or ^^ constant
		1 - dummy parameter, but must be present

New command for receiver UX
	!!UX:D#;
		# - string, z-var or ^^ constant. Maximum size: 256 chars.
UX:D allows to display error message using internal tools. Might be useful for debugging. Works with UN:P904 and UN:P905

[+] In Lua/ERM you can use ".pre" ".firstpre" ".post" instead of ".?" ".first?" ".$".
[+] In Lua/ERM trigger type (pre, firstpost) letter case no longer matters. You can use "FirstPost", or "FiRsTpOsT".
[-+] AI:M and AI:W, when used with base value, accepts ONLY get syntax. 
[+] MR:N displays error when used with set syntax. 
[+] BG:Q displays error when used with set syntax
[+] Logs moved to woglogs/ folder. Remember to make it in release!
[+] We have now LuaLog, WOGERMLOG, WOGVARLOG, WOGCRASHLOG and WOGCRASHDUMP. A lot, but it makes sense.
[ ] Many Lua/ERM errors are managed by C code and doesn't cause crash. Additionally allows me to immediately show argument and parameter values. 
[ ] Old saves will NOT work.

Self-caused bugs
[-] options.lua was scrapping Wog Options. Fixed, but you need to manually change constant value in both C++ header and Lua file.

Found bugs:
[-] When using Lua/ERM, post triggers ($) cause error with _NOGLOBALS macro. I believe game mistake them as macros. Not fixed, but i have added .pre and .post syntax - those works. For example, now you can use OB(11).pre = function() 
[-+] When using Lua/ERM, BA:B(string) is broken. Not fixed, instead used StrMan::Apply in extended syntax - that does work well
Not-fixed bugs
[ ] Using BA:B - no matter, old or new syntax - while using HD Mod opens a terminal with filename. Closing this terminal closes the game aswell. Not fixed
[ ] WoG options - at least, the hardcoded ones - are scrapped when starting WoG map. On other maps works fine. Not fixed
[ ] Lua/ERM errors can cause segmentation fault, due to accessing EAX=0x03. Replacing those errors with ERM errors fixes that.
[ ] Dumping values can cause game crash (to be precise: loop responsible for ERM traceback causes crash) Commented both traceback loops.
