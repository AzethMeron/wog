COMMUNICATION LUA C++
by person who has no idea about embedding Lua in C++, trying to figure out source
sorry if im stating obvious shit, or misleading

EXECUTING LUA SCRIPTS OF ENGINE
At the beginning, C++ parses main.lua file.
Scripts in Lua folder are manually called by main.lua, in hardcoded order. 
Additionally, all *.lua files in Lua/Misc folder are called. This is directory for many extension scripts, like New Campaign support.

EXPOSING VARIABLES (and functions?)
Done inside erm_lua.cpp, in function 'void InitLua()'
cpp:
	LuaInternalConst("PL_WONUM", PL_WONUM);
lua:
	local internal = debug.getregistry()
	pl_wonum = internal.PL_WONUM
example above copies value of macro PL_WONUM (C++) into variable pl_wonum in Lua. 

LUA EVENTS CALLED FROM C++ SRC (by using LuaCall("EventName"))
to be used with -- function global.events.EventName() ... end
i've noticed there's global.events.EnterContext() but i couldn't find it in c++
