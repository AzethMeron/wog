Call function with number # instead
Inside FU trigger you have arguments
x1 - hero owner
x2 - hero number

Wog Legacy naming convention:
- All new files are in WogLegacy dir
- All new files starts with WL
- A means addition to
- New header files ends with hpp
- Ending _C.hpp means it is extension of some .cpp file
So, WLA_ERM_C.hpp means Wog Legacy addition to erm.cpp

There are much more Wog Options (UN:P) than before. In WLA_ERM.hpp there are 2 constants:
#define WL_PL_WONUM (1000)
#define WL_PL_WONUM_SPEC (200)
First one means 'number of normal UN:P' - no changes to those.
Second one are new - you can't edit them via UN:P. They are used to store data by me in source. 
It is very easy way to make variables that are automatically stored in savefile and shared in multiplayer.
Im not experienced enough yet to make my own variables. Note that every change to any of consts will make saves uncompatible, and you still can change those values
for example via WoG options dialog.

[+] New v-vars: v10001-v10100
[+] New functions (FU30001-FU40000) BUT those are for tests only. Number will be decreased when API will be proven to work fine.
[+] HE, HL, HM triggers now supports number of heroes above 199.
[ ] Old saves will NOT work.

Self-caused bugs
[-] options.lua was scrapping Wog Options. Fixed, but you need to manually change constant value in both C++ header and Lua file.
