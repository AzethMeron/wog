New syntax for receiver BA
	!!BA:B#/1;
		$ - string, z-var or ^^ constant
		1 - dummy parameter, but must be present

[+] In Lua/ERM you can use ".pre" ".firstpre" ".post" instead of ".?" ".first?" ".$".
[+] In Lua/ERM trigger type (pre, firstpost) letter case no longer matters. You can use "FirstPost", or "FiRsTpOsT".
[ ] Old saves will NOT work.

Self-caused bugs
[-] options.lua was scrapping Wog Options. Fixed, but you need to manually change constant value in both C++ header and Lua file.

Found bugs:
[-] When using Lua/ERM, post triggers ($) cause error with _NOGLOBALS macro. I believe game mistake them as macros. Not fixed, but i have added .pre and .post syntax - those works. For example, now you can use OB(11).pre = function() 
[ ] When using Lua/ERM, BA:B(string) is broken. Not fixed, instead used StrMan::Apply in extended syntax - that does work well
